Reminders
- No one way to conceptualize an OOP Program
- Meant to organize data

Example Exercises
Create a program that includes the following:
1. An abstract class Animal
   - with a constructor that takes the Animal's name as an argument
   - and an abstract method move().
2. An interface Bird with a single method fly().
3. An interface Fish with a single method swim().
4. An interface Mammal with a single method walk().

Notice
- Implementations of each of those interfaces that also extend Animal. 
  For example:
  class Cat extends Animal implements Mammal{ Cat(String name){ super(name); }
  void move(){ walk(); }
  void walk(){ println(name + " goes pitter patter."); } }
- Extensions of each of those classes that modify the baseline behavior.
  For example:
  class Kitten extends Cat{ Kitten(String name){ super(name); }
  void walk(){ println(name + " clumsily pounces."); } }
