# Object Orientated Programming through Processing-Java
Learning OOP through the Processing Driver, Pure-Java Constructor, and .pde or Pure-Java Classes

- An Example Italian Designer: https://vimeo.com/ignaziolucenti
- Their GitHub Repository for Learning Processing, <a href="https://github.com/lignazio/Learning-Processing">Click Here</a>
- Clone the Repo and View ```particles_magneticFlowField```
- Interesting Project to visualize influences on Magnetic Flow
- For Reminders about Magnetic Flow
  - Google Image "particles around a magnet"

Table of Contents
Here, we are drawing Pong Balls in different ways, and making them move in different ways (with the mouse instead)
1. Arithmetic of Moving a Ball, <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/CS30/tree/master/Objective%20Processing-Java/Moving%20Ball#moving-ball">Click Here</a>
   - OOP Java Concepts:
     - Creating a Pure-Java Class within Processing and Accessing Visual Information
     - Passing arguments to create instances of objects where variable tracking is abstract (the computer does it, we do not, yet)
     - Access Modifiers: public, private
     - Getters, issues of security
2. Drawing many Pong Balls to the Canvas, changing them with Every Mouse Click, <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/CS30/tree/master/Objective%20Processing-Java/Many%20Ball">Click Here</a>
   - Note: this Problem Set is often seen as a "Star Problem", which exemplifies talking a similar problem and adapting it to met other ideas
   - Processing-Java Concepts & Functions:
     - mixing Pure-Java and Processing-Java Classes and Methods
     - random()
   - OOP Java Concepts
     - Using an Array to store objects: array syntax, array.length,
     - Access Modifiers: static, variable
     - Final Variables
3. Potential Project: combine Moving Ball (target from mouseX & mouseY) and Many Ball (all object instances move to one location)
   - Purpose: what you do not understand, but believe you do, will be illustrated clearly ... then you will have questions to ask
4. Two x Work Periods: complete 3 (Potential Project) or return to the Object-based Pong Game
5. Paired Partner Programming Assignment, Project (Review of all of OPP to Date)
   - See <a href="https://github.com/QEHS-ProcessingJava/Ideas-for-OPP">For Teacher Only Files while writting this</a>

# Ideas to Include
Ways to Ball Chase better
- math to make ball movement smoother instead of like Pong Ball, not a 45-degree line and then 1D lines to "make up the distance"
