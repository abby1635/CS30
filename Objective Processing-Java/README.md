- An Example Italian Designer: https://vimeo.com/ignaziolucenti
- Their GitHub Repository for Learning Processing, <a href="https://github.com/lignazio/Learning-Processing">Click Here</a>
- Clone the Repo and View ```particles_magneticFlowField```
- Interesting Project to visualize influences on Magnetic Flow
- For Reminders about Magnetic Flow
  - Google Image "particles around a magnet"

# Ideas to Include
Ways to Ball Chase better
- math to make ball movement smoother instead of like Pong Ball, not a 45-degree line and then 1D lines to "make up the distance"
