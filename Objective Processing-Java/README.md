- Clone the Repo and View ```particles_magneticFlowField```
- Interesting Project to visualize influences on Magnetic Flow
- For Reminders about Magnetic Flow
  - Google Image "particles around a magnet"

## Arithmetic of Moving a Ball & Creating a Driver and Classes
Purpose of this Program
1. Add imagination to Pong
2. Introduction to Class Design and Case Studies

OOP Java Concepts
- Access Modifiers
- Getters

Case Study:
- Problem Situation: if a ball starts from the center of a canvas, how will it move to a target arithmetically
- Solution uses incrementation and a conditional

Progression of Programs in the Pathway
- BouncingBall_Start: boilerplate, creating Pure-Java Classes within .pde constructor
  - Object creates instances
  - "What does instance know about itself" ... referring to actual numbers, not actual numbers
  - How is the processing accomplished on "what the instance knows about itself"
  - Naming object variables, classes, procedures within classes
  - "this.variable"
  - passing parameters to class to construct the instance of the object

- BouncingBall_Chase.pde: adding arithmetic to animate ball, adding mouse interactions and variables of target
  - Finishing a Case Study about the arithmetic
  - "Why does this work? Explore"

# Ideas to Include
Ways to Ball Chase better
- math to make ball movement smoother instead of like Pong Ball
