Prototype each class before combining
- ball bounces and scores
- paddles bounde and move
- firework goes at goal and bounce of other team
- scoreboard prints score

Unique Coding
- Empty IF, similar to Empty draw()

Ball Class: direction, speed, colour, bounces ... scores
- speed set at beginning, meant to increase
- all balls start in center, final variable
- all diameters are same
- Bounce is not half off the screen
- Goal area (redo this)
  - in paddle area, before goal ... bounce
  - past paddle, anywhere, score, based on ball-diameter/2 ratio
  - think about drawing rect() for net area
  - if in net, redraw so stuck in net ... communication with Firework and Scoreboard Objects
- Ball Squish needs to be written
- Bug: ScorePlayer1 & 2 incrementing but not summing into next Score1 & 2 Varaible

CAUTION: Scoring not done
- Scoring needs to be written to activate Firework in certain area

Pure-Java
- Needs Security, Getters and Setters
