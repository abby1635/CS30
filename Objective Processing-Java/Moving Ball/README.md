# Moving Ball
(Also "Arithmetic of Moving a Ball & Creating a Driver and Classes")

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Purpose of this Program
1. Add imagination to Pong
2. Introduction to Class Design and Case Studies

Case Study:
- Problem Situation: if a ball starts from the center of a canvas, how will it move to a target arithmetically
- Solution uses incrementation and a conditional

Creating a Processing-Java | Pure-Java Program
- Folder and Name must match (issue of Java Compiler)
- Creating new TABs within Processing-Java, including file extension of .java, allows Pure-Java Classes

Progression of Programs in this Pathway
- BouncingBall_Start: boilerplate, creating Pure-Java Classes within .pde constructor
  - Object creates instances
  - "What does instance know about itself" ... referring to actual numbers, not actual numbers
  - How is the processing accomplished on "what the instance knows about itself"
  - Naming object variables, classes, procedures within classes
  - "this.variable"
  - passing parameters to class to construct the instance of the object

- BouncingBall_Chase.pde: adding arithmetic to animate ball, adding mouse interactions and variables of target

- BouncingBall_Chase_Private: modifying access to variables and creating getters for security
  - Must fix the error before it runs properly
  - Private & Public modifiers
  - Creating Getter Functions for private access modifiers
  - To fix the first error, run the Getter Function for X & Y: ```ball.x to ball.getX()```

  - Note: BouncingBall_Chase_Getters.pde describes debugging
