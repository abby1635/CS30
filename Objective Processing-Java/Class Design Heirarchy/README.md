# Class Design and Hierarchy
Abstract Classes and Extending Classes

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

# Ideas to Include
Progression
- Main Program: name, void setup(), draw()
- Abstract Class & Extending Rectangle Class: flip between these for declaration, assignment through constructor
- Add to setup() and draw()
  - size() for geometry
  - background for draw
- Create ArrayList for Abstract Class Shape, shapes
  - add and get(0), notice class functions mimic reading and writing to arrays
  - drawing is like an array
- Create abstract and "real" procedures for classes, so object knows to draw itself
  - Must access both abstract and object procedures since both are loaded into the ArrayList
- Declare the arguments for the rectangle (play with color, hexadecimal and randomizing RGB)
- Try executing to the CANVAS: notice something simple is using class design and heirarchy
- Reuse the code to draw another rect(), using the random RGB colours
- Assignment: create a circle class and load it to the shapes-ArrayList
