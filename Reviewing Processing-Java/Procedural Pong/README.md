# Procedural Pong, Reminders about Creating Procedures
Focus on Boilerplate for Procedural Pong

Creating a Procedure for Global Variables
- Any variables at the beginning any tabs, before the first "void" are considered Global Variables)

**CAUTION**: the main Processing-Java File must have void setup(){} and void draw(){} for the Java Compiler

Creating New TABS, which are separate files
- Click Arrow / New table
- Name the TAB the same name as the Procedure, block of code (procedure) or return variable (like a calculator)

Creating a VOID Procedure
- First line of TAB ```void nameOfProcedure () {}```
  - No Parameters: ```void nameOfProcedure () {}```
  - Including Parameters: ```void nameOfProcedure ( parameter1, parameter2, parameter3 ) {} //able to have as many parameters as you want```
- Copy code to the Braces
- Notes: CTRL-T will auto-format the procedure

- Call the Procedure in the Main File
- With no arguments: ```nameOfProcedure ();```
- With arguments: ```nameOfProcedure ( parameter1, parameter2, parameter3 );```

Creating a RETURN Procedure
- ID the type of variable you need returned to the line of code you are calling the procedure in
  - Whole Number or Integer: int
  - Decimal Value: float or double
  - Single Character: char
  - WORDS or Phrases: String

- First line of TAB, returning int: ```int nameOfProcedure () {}```
  - No Parameters: ```void nameOfProcedure () {}```
  - Including Parameters: ```int nameOfProcedure ( parameter1, parameter2, parameter3 ) {} //able to have as many parameters as you want```
- Copy code to the Braces
- Notes: CTRL-T will auto-format the procedure
- Last Line File: ```return variableName;```

- Call the Procedure in the Main File
- With no arguments: ```nameOfProcedure ();```
- With arguments: ```nameOfProcedure ( parameter1, parameter2, parameter3 );```
- Note: the value of what is returned is 'replaced' in the ```nameOfProcedure ();```
