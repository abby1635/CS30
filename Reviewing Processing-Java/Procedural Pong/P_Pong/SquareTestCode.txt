POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS (Needs to be coded)
- Adjusting the Canvas Width and Height (using defined width and height variables instead of keywords)

Simpler Solution in P_Pong.pde
- Print Errors to console, quit game automatically
- Compare canvas to full screen values, quit if canvas too big
- Compare canvas width and height to establish "square-ness"

Original Notes, Possible Solution
- Change the incrementation of the ball so it does not bounce in a square
- Seems like an odd solution, against physics of regular formed ball
