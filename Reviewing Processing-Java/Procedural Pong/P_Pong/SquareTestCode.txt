NOTE: this needs to be debugged
- Adjusting the Canvas Width and Height may be too much
- Perhpas simply quite the screen and give feedback to the cansole

if (width == height) {
    println ("Full Screen Debugging :", displayWidth, displayHeight);
    if (width*1.1 < displayWidth) {
      width = int (width*1.1);
    }
    if (height*1.1 < displayHeight) {
      height = int (height*1.1);
    }
    if (width == height) {
      println ("Canvas size problem, please adjust");
  }
