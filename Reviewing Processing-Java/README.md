General Ideas
- What does the ball need to know about itself?

## What the ball knows about itself and related ideas

- BallX: where ball will be when printed to the screen, x-axis
- BallY: where ball will be when printed to the screen, y-axis
- BallStartX: starting position of ball at the beginning of a game, x-axis
- BallStartY: starting position of ball at the beginning of a game, y-axis
- BallDiameter: diameter of the ball

Other Ideas
- Diameter, Radius and Formula to solve these ideas
- Where it starts on the Pong table

Upload starter and example

Making the ball move: students need to use the create ball code and add movement and stopping
- starting code with errors
  - review:
  - Start Code has logic and variable naming errors
- finished code without errors
- Note: able to use x+1 but try to use +=1

Making the ball stop at the edge so the edge of the ball stops

Making the ball Bounces

Making a counter increment to illustrate score
