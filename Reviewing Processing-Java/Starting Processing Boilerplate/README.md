- When was Pong First Coded

  - In 1972, Alan Alcom coded Pong as a Training exercise from Nolan Bushnell, co-founder of Atari
  - Consider this ... we still play Pong and use Pong as a Training Exercise to learn coding

Completing a Case Study
- Draw and Label GUI
- Describe behaviours
  - Bounces off top, bottom, and paddles
  - Into net on left and right sides
  - Score Board changes
- Additions
  - Randomize the ball start a little better

Sandboxing Lessons

Creating the ball
- Size (): key variables width & height, also fullScreen() and displayWidth & displayHeight
- Ratios for ball function

Making the ball move: students need to use the create ball code and add movement and stopping
- starting code with errors
  - review:
  - Start Code has logic and variable naming errors
- finished code without errors
- Note: able to use x+1 but try to use +=1

Making the ball stop at the edge so the edge of the ball stops

Making the ball Bounces

Making a counter increment to illustrate score
