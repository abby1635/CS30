General Ideas and Progression
- Move the Ball Down: MoveDown
  - Layering for animation: background, full or partial, starts
  - Ball needs to move "smallest perceivable" pixel to make movement "at a certain speed" a believable illusion
  - Remember, ball needs to be above the "lowest height", or largest y-axis value
  - Review Print and Println lines in Processing, with concatenation
  - Review x=x+1 operation and associated code, including shorthand
  - Introduce angles of ball movement based on x & y axis movement
  - Review Colour Selection: RGB Colours and Randomizing (same as ball movement), Hexadecimal Colours and Copying Value
  - Option: turn off either x or y axis (IF Statement) and view ball movement in one dimension
  - Additions to the
    - change the 1 to a variable, assign the variable 1
    - Option: assign the variable an operation to control the speed
- Making the ball bounce once
  - Need to explore the idea of adding a variable but reversing direction with arithmetic
