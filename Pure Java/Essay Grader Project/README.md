# Essay Grade Project
Continuing from CS10 Websites (Creating an Interactive Essay)

Purpose:
- Use String Functions and data structures
- Using Search Algorithms

# Ideas to Include

1/2 Period: brainstorm behaviors of an essay grader (meta literacy about essay pieces)
- See image of sections and example behaviors

1/2 Period: brainstorm behaviors of an essay grader (meta literacy about essay pieces)
- Adding Ideas
- Expanding on ideas that were left "for thinking to be returned to"

# Previous Student ideas

Case Study Ideas
- Spelling Specific: last letter of previous word is first letter of current work, space in wrong place
  - remove first letter, check spelling of previous word with removed letter; if true ... replace automatically
  - after removed letter, check spelling of rest of word; if true ... fix immediately

Main Coding Parts
- Paragraph into args (auto separate spaces)
- Search for words per sentence (search for ending punctuation)
- Search for capital letters
  - Beginning of Paragraph
  - After each
- Additional punctuation to remove
  - Quotations
  - Parenthesis (including braces and brackets)
- Create paragraph-word list and search for only letter characters
  - Alert developer if this list is in error
- Copy paragraph-word list and

Additional Features
- Characters per word, average
- Range of words with a number of characters in it

Lesson for Sorting
- Option: Search Types to Explore (Use Decks of cards)
- ARGS is populated with "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
- Vocabulary words are "Fox", "Jump", "Dog"
  - Issues: proper noun, subject-predicate agreement, punctuation
- Linear Sort: most amount of comparison (do not increase comparisons past linear search)
  - Stop searching when <string.length() (similar to CS10 Music Player Next Button ArrayIndexOutOfBounds Error)
  - Compare with another array (i.e. array holding vocabulary words)
- Binary Search: starts in the middle and tests if it should be left or right
  - see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3YID7liBug
  - can only be done on sorted data
  - thus will always be slower than linear
- Exchange Sort: see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfFS1kl0aM
  - Result makes <= operator true in final array
  - Compares two adjacent items at a time
- Insertion Sort: see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGzPmgsI-pQ
  - Comparisons to index-zero, if necessary (similar to CS10 Music Player Previous Button ArrayIndexOutOfBounds Error)
  - much less efficient on large data than quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort
- Selection Sort
  - See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWBP4lzkoyM
- Merge Sort
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqmGXwpLqc
- Cocktail Sort
  - See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sn5MAZdnYlY
- Other Sorts
  - gnome sort
  - comb sort
  - Selection sort: strand sort
  - Insertion sort: library sort
  - Quicksort?
  - Heap sort?
