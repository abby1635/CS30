# Hello World
Using Pure Java and the JAVAC Compiler through a Command Window

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Tools will be using
- WINDOWS Folders
- CMD.exe
  - Note: able to use PowerShell but instruction will use CMD.exe
  - Similar to Terminal in Linux (Raspberry Pi Computer) and utilizing devices built for Internet of Things
- WYSIWYG: Atom (students are able to use text editor of their choice as long as multiple files open concurrently, like Notepad++)

Review of JAVAC Complier
- Reads Java using 3 locators
  1. Main Program matches Folder name
  2. Main Program's first line within ```public static void main (String[] args)```

- Compared to Processing-JAVA
  - Folder and Program Name match
  - Main Program contains
    ```java
    void setup() {}
    void draw() {}
    ```
