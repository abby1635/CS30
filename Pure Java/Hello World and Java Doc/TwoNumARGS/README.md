# Adding Two Numbers and using ARGS[]
A Project illustrating how to build a method anticipating errors

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

General Progression
- Input 2 variables to args[] (arg[0] & args[1])
- Parse from string to integer
- Send variables to a method, returning answer
- Print class to console

Pure Java Concepts
- Accessing ARGS as an option
- Using Try-Catch
- Exceptions
- Exit and numbering logs
- Parsing Data
- Writing simple Procedural return
- Using toString()

# Ideas to Include

List of Errors (Numbering refers to program name too)
1. Args[]: no values entered, ArrayIndexOutOfBounds
   - Case Studies
     - 3, 4
     - 3, four
     - null, 4 (note, it is impossible to use ARGs and null, this array is unique)
2.

Ideas to include
- Number formatting from float or double
- Parsing Boolean, int, long, float, double
- Include division by zero as arithmetic error
- Using toString()
- Using Character Escapes

String toString() calling toString(): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmEpfNOpfZ0
- method
- uses concatenation (comman or plus)
- Uses character escapes
