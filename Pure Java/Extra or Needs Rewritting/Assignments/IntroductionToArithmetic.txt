Summary
- Even Odd Program (Question 1)
- Squares and Random (Question 2)
- Place Value Program (Question 3)





Queston 1 (Even Odd Program)

Write a program using control structure decision making to print 
whether a number is an even OR an odd number.

Your Program Must
- Use if-else statements and modulus operator
- Test inputs will be
  Positive & Negative Even & Odd Numbers
  Decimal Values
  Character only values

Example outputs
15 is an odd number
8 is an even number

Java Theory Questions
- State the maximum number of extended if-statements reasonably possible?
- Describe how the logic flows of
  IF
  IF-ELSE
  IF-ElseIF-Else
- Describe the logic of a SWITCH Statement.
- State the IF statement structure that codes the same as the AND operator.

Getting Ready for this Program
Example returns of modulus
int remainder1 = 15 % 2;		// remainder1 is 1
int remainder2 = 16 % 2;		// remainder2 is 0
int remainder3 = 17 % 2;		// remainder3 is 1
int remainder4 = 18 % 2;		// remainder4 is 0

Also, by definition, 0 % (any number) = 0.
For example, 0 % 3 = 0, 0 % 22 = 0, etc.

Extra-Credit Reading
The modulus operator is helpful for finding remainders, 
but it is also the foundation for “public-key cryptography” 
which allows us to send information such as grade transcripts, 
online purchases, credit card payments, 
and bank statements securely through the Internet.



Question 2 (Squares and Random)
See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2bjRHpYhBU

Write a program that uses a FOR and a WHILE loop to print numbers 1 through 10, 
whole numbers only. With each number, complete two math calculations on it. 
First, calculate it’s square. 
Second, calculate a random number between the number and 
the square, inclusively. 
Separate these by a TAB.

Example Output using FOR Loop
Here’s some sample output:
#	x^2	Random in Range
1	1	1
2	4	2
3	9	5
4	16	11
5	25	22
6	36	32
7	49	49
8	64	55
9	81	56
10	100	67

Example Output Explanation
If # = 4, then square = 16, and random is between 4 & 16 (11 given above)
If # = 7, then square = 49, and random is between 7 and 49 (49 given above)

Your Program Must
- Output two tables separated by TAB: one with a FOR Loop and the other with
  a WHILE Loop

Program coding hints
- Escape \t will TAB each output
  For example: System.out.println( number + “\t“ + numberSquared);
- Java.lang.math.random() returns random double values >= 0.0 & < 1
  Your program must be inclusive, not exclusive at the upper range
  Thus, use multiplication to get the random value “into the range” 
    of needed “random” values
  Hint: try a few multiplication statements to figure this out
- Thus, must error check the random value and if it in the range of values
- Remember: casting might not round so rounding needs to be checked for errors
- FOR Loops evaluate for TRUE at the end of the loop
  It seems like the evaluation is at the beginning, influences control
- WHILE Loops evaluate for TRUE at the beginning of the loop,
  influences control differently

Java Theory Questions
- How the FOR and WHILE increments differently
- When control is passed to the line immediately following the loop

Extra-Credit Reading
See Baron’s Page 66
- Describe the difference between i++ and ++i in FOR Loops.
- What are the two different returns of println(++i) and print(i++).
- Describe how the order of i++ and ++I influence the above outputs.

Coding for joystick controllers uses a WHILE Loop for simplicity.
For example, a program using only a joystick might use
While ( 1 = 1 ); // Always TRUE
This creates constantly looping code that functions as a listener, 
waiting for the controller to return values from it’s sensors to the motors.

Another example might be
While ( off = 0 ); 
// off is controlled by a button on the controller that increments ints
This would turn off the device and the joystick when the device 
is in a safe location. It also allows a user to “pound” on the button 
and the repeated button pressing to be error checked for 
“Try to be easy on your controller.”



Question 3 (Place Value)

Write a program to determine the number of digits in a given integer, 
similar to counting place value or writing the exponent in 10^x.

Your Program Must
- Use a number with more than 12 place values or a magnitude of 10^12
- Choose a “large” integer number randomly
- Output the number of digits in the number

Hint: use a loop and integer division to in this algorithm.

Extending this problem
- Repeat a number with hexadecimal number (like a hexadecimal color)
- Repeat a number with binary
- Use the incrementation function of the FOR Loop to control 
  what base-10 number the computer counts to 
- Bonus: create a program that “counts” in base-10 to any base and 
  print out what that number might be in base-10 symbols
- Extended Bonus: create a set of strings to represent the 
  symbols in the base that will represent what the base-10 number 
  will be rewritten as in your chosen base
