Introduction to Strings Assignment

Note to student: try to case study and build the standard case first,
  Then build the more advanced cases

Using args, Scanner Class, or JOptionPane input options your program must
- Start with an argument being passed and handle 
  the error that no argument is passed
- Accept a username and password (either a string or number)
  to start the program
  Standard: if not correct, program will not start
  Almost Excellence: program will trim accidently added spaces
  Excellence: adds new usernames and passwords
  Perfect:
    - Memory Structure allows user to pick the number of stored 
      usernames and passwords, user can also change this
    - Index Exceptions are automatically catched and corrected
      For example: a user could enter 4 usernames, then 8, then 10000
      Note: decreaseing entries is not necessary here but would be cool
- Accept 4 names in one string-array, similar to lesson
  Standard: predetermined names in a string, similar to lesson
    (can be hard coded)
  Excellence: any 4 random names, no spaces inbetween
- Separate single string of names into separate names stored
  in another data structure (i.e. another array)
- Order names in alphebetical order
  Standard: ordered based on first letter only
  Excellence: ordered based on additional letters
  Perfection: ordered based on all letters in all names
- All string entries are automatically trimmed for spaces
  especially additional passwords
  Note: use the Adding Two Numbers program to remind yourself of how to 
  create a procedure within a class that is called whenever it is needed

Program must handle the following errors
- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: for any part of the code where an array can 
  possibly go out of bounds
