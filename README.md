### Introduction to Code Controlling Robotic Interactions: Warehouses, Grocery Stores, and Grocery Items
Videos of Automated Groceries Stores and Warehouses
- Purpose: develop Ideas about what automation means
- Amazon Go: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrmMk1Myrxc
- Amazon Warehouse Robots: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLVCGEmkJs0
- Warehouse where grocery cart is "object focus": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DKrcpa8Z_E
- Receiving Warehouse, releasing Pallet to Stores like Amazon Go: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn5jjVKhFUs
- All-in-one Warehouse, shipping to individuals, businesses, etc.: https://www.wsj.com/video/autonomous-robots-in-the-grocery-warehouse/52D0ECC8-C0F6-4E9A-B6CB-CD4AAD31E1D4.html
- Option: discussion about all the videos point towards as an eventual reality
